## Project Goals
In summary this repo will establish the basics of using gitHub and improving (refactoring) simple HTML code.  
============================================================================================================    
Github:  
    Create Repo  
    Clone to local machine   
    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  
    Copy sample files from Demo folder (likely hardest part!)   
    -- Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzipping likely fastest method.     
    -- Could not find a quicker way to copy over all files.    
    ... refactor HTML ...  
    Commit and push files back to gitHub  
    Deploy code  
    Make Sure it Works  
  
HTML:   
    View the Acceptance Criteria. 
    Improve the file (refactor).   
  
    (a) follows accessibility standards - added alts, better names for html tags, made sure language set.
    (1) source code - semantic HTML elements 
        Head, Body (Title (nav), Main(), Footer), etc.
    (2) HTML elements - elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    (3) icon and image elements - accessible alt attributes = added alts
    (4) heading attributes - fall in sequential order
    (5) title element - concise, descriptive title (Horseon Marketing Agency)
    Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%
    (a) Links all function correctly. (Fixed First Line)
    (b) CSS selector-properties consolidated-organized to follow semantic structure.   
        (Updated - a and p at beginning, content section together.)
    (c) CSS file is properly commented.  - Added comments.
