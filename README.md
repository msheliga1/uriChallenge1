Michael Sheliga 11.16.23

This repo is for the University of Richmond (URI) coding bootcamp.  
This is the week 1 challenge due 11.16.23. 

In summary this repo will establish the basics of using gitHub and improving (refactoring) simple HTML code.  
a============================================================================================================    
Github:  
    Create Repo  
    Clone to local machine   
    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  
    Copy sample files from Demo folder (likely hardest part!)   
    -- Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzipping likely fastest method.     
    -- Could not find a quicker way to copy over all files.    
    ... refactor HTML ...  
    Commit and push files back to gitHub  
    Deploy code  
    Make Sure it Works  
  
HTML:   
    View the Acceptance Criteria   
    Improve the file (refactor) based upon it
